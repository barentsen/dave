*Because finding and vetting K2 planets rocks.*

# The Plan
To find and vet planets with K2 we have the following steps:
1. Create a subset of targets for testing
2. Light Curve Genertion/CoTrend -- remove instrumental stuff
	e.g. PDC light curves
	     DFM method
3. Detrend/Search for planets -- BLS
4. Fitting a planetary model
5. Vetting Metrics
6. Outputs
